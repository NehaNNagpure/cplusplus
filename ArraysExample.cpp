	C++ supports 3 basic ways of creating and using strings.
	Using an Array of char elements. 
	Using string class.
	Using wchar_t for wide charecters.
	Array of charecters is a basically a string. It is also a char Pointer.A String is sequence of charecters. If char represents single charecter, then Array of char represents a string. Declartion/definitions are same like any other array...
	All strings in C++ are null terminating strings. The last element of the Array would be \0.
	We have string based operations in the form of string functions to perform assignments, copying , removing and so forth...
	strcpy is used to copy one charArray into another...
