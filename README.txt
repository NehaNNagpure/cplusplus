using namespace std;
class complex
{
private:
int a,b,c;
public:
complex()
{
cout<<"cdac banglore"<<endl;
}
complex(int s,int g)
{
a=s;
b=g;
cout<<a;
cout<<b;
}
complex(int m,int n,int k)
{
a=s;
b=g;
c=k;
cout<<a;
cout<<b;
cout<<c:
}
~complex()////////////////////destructor is called
{
cout<<"cdac banglore";
}
void main()
{
complex v;
complex m(10,20);
complex n(10,20,30);
}
output-cdac banglore
